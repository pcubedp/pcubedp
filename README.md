### 💡 About Me

**1st Year (soon 2nd Year) CS undergrad @DJSCE**

I enjoy building just as much as breaking things down to understand how they work.

My journey into development began on a dual-boot setup, building games in Roblox Studio using Lua and distro hopping between Linux Mint and Windows,then onto Debian, before finally settling on Arch Linux (yeah, partly for the bragging rights, but it really does feel like home).

I'm especially drawn to DevOps and Backend, and lately exploring cloud-native tools out there.

My next goal is to dive into open-source projects and start my contribution journey. I'm always up for connecting with others who are equally passionate about tech, design, or anything in between.

Outside the terminal, I’ve always leaned into visual work. From UI/UX to graphic design, I enjoy creating things that not only function well but also feel intentional and visually compelling.
